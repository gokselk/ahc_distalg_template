========

This study focuses on the implementation and performance evaluation of the Echo algorithm within simulated ad hoc network environments using Python. Nodes in these networks function as individual processes that communicate via a messaging system, particularly handling "ECHO_START" and "ECHO_MESSAGE" communications to manage and propagate information effectively. The algorithm was tested across different network topologies: star, ring, and mesh, assessing its ability to transmit messages efficiently and gather responses comprehensively. Performance metrics were drawn from the number of messages sent and the communication rounds required, with statistical analyses comparing these results against theoretical expectations. The findings indicate that the Echo algorithm performs robustly, adhering closely to predicted message complexities and demonstrating efficient information dissemination across various network configurations. This validation confirms the algorithmâ€™s practical applicability and reliability in distributed network communication tasks.
