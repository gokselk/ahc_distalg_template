Introduction
============

The exploration of networked systems for various purposes, including constructing spanning trees and facilitating network traversal, is a fundamental challenge in distributed computing. A particular interest lies in efficiently navigating these networks to understand their structure and dynamics without redundant or excessive communications, which is crucial for optimization and management of distributed systems.

Understanding and efficiently traversing a network is not only fascinating but also critical for a wide range of applications in distributed systems. From optimizing resource allocation to ensuring efficient data routing and system maintenance, the ability to traverse a network efficiently underpins the performance and reliability of distributed computing tasks. Solving this challenge allows for more efficient network operations, while failure to do so can result in increased network traffic, higher costs, and reduced performance.

The complexity of network traversal arises from the need to visit each node in a network without revisiting nodes excessively, which could lead to inefficiencies and increased network traffic. Naive approaches may fail due to the non-trivial structure of networks, which can include cycles, varying sizes, and complex topologies, making it challenging to ensure comprehensive and efficient traversal without redundant communications.

While various traversal algorithms exist, such as Tarry's algorithm and traversal algorithms designed for undirected networks, they often involve trade-offs between message complexity, time complexity, and bit complexity. Previous solutions may not efficiently address all types of networks or may incur high overheads. The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm offers a distinct approach by prioritizing exploration depth, potentially reducing the time and messages needed for certain network topologies, yet it introduces its own challenges and complexities.

The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, as applied in this project, emphasizes exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, a strategy that can lead to more efficient traversal in certain network structures. This approach is characterized by its ability to construct a spanning tree with minimal redundancy, effectively reducing message complexity in some cases. However, the DFS algorithm may encounter limitations in terms of increased complexity when dealing with networks that contain cycles or require specific traversal orders.
