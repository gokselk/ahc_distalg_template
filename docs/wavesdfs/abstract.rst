The DFS traversal algorithm, when applied within a simulated ad hoc network, proved to be highly effective across various network structures, from simple linear arrays to complex fully connected graphs. The empirical results matched theoretical predictions, demonstrating that the algorithm scales well with the size and complexity of the network by sending approximately two messages per edge. This performance is reflected in diverse network topologies where, for instance, linear networks showed predictable scalability, trees minimized message overhead, and fully connected networks navigated high connectivity with increased message traffic. Overall, the successful deployment of the DFS algorithm underscores its utility for ensuring comprehensive and orderly node visits within networked systems, highlighting its potential adaptability to more dynamic or unpredictable network environments. This implementation confirms the algorithm's capacity for maintaining essential properties such as safety and liveness, making it a reliable choice for network traversal tasks.
