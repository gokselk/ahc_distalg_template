Implementation, Results and Discussion
======================================

Implementation and Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DFS algorithm was implemented in a simulated ad hoc network environment using Python. This simulation included nodes modeled as individual processes with the ability to communicate via a custom-designed messaging system. The key aspect of this implementation was the creation and management of "DFS_START" and "DFS_FORWARD" messages to orchestrate the traversal process, ensuring each node was visited according to the DFS strategy.

To verify the implementation, the algorithm was deployed across a network of simulated nodes structured in various topologies including linear, tree, and fully connected graphs. Each node was equipped with functionality to send, receive, and process messages, ensuring the traversal logic was correctly followed. The network's behavior was logged to track the path of traversal and to validate the maintenance of the DFS propertiesâ€”safety and liveness.

The measurements focused on the number of messages sent and the total number of hops (node visits) required to complete the traversal. Statistical analysis was applied to evaluate the efficiency and performance across different network topologies, comparing the expected versus actual outcomes.

Results
~~~~~~~~

The implementation of the DFS traversal algorithm in a simulated ad hoc network demonstrated robust performance across different topologies. The results indicated that the number of messages required closely aligned with theoretical expectations, approximating to two times the number of edges in the network.

The table below summarizes key metrics observed during the simulations:

     - Efficient for simple chains but scales linearly with node count.
   * - Tree (10 nodes)
     - 9
     - Shows optimal performance in hierarchical structures; fewer messages due to structured navigation.
   * - Fully Connected (10 nodes)

     - High message count due to each node connecting to every other node.

Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

The outcomes of the implementation confirm the effectiveness of the DFS algorithm across various network topologies. It was observed that the message complexity indeed approximated O(2E), aligning with theoretical predictions. This confirms the algorithm's scalability and efficiency in practical scenarios. The safety and liveness properties were consistently maintained, with each node being visited exactly once and all reachable nodes being covered in every simulation.

Further studies could explore the impact of dynamic changes within the network, such as node failures or the addition of new nodes, and how the DFS algorithm adapts to such changes. This would provide deeper insights into its robustness and resilience under varying network conditions.
